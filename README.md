# Brew Control

This is the source for my Arduino-based temperature controller for my
electric brewing setup.

This is built on [the badge from the BSidesSLC 2015
conference](https://github.com/thetransistor/BSidesSLC2015), since I had
it lying around collecting dust and it already has a screen and input
controls. It turned out to be perfect for this use case.

As such, this won't be immediately useful to anybody else -- you'd most
likely have to modify the code for whatever screen+input your Arduino is
wired to.
